    <h1>Overview of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania</h1>
    <p>HIV/AIDS remain one of the most significant public health challenges in Tanzania. The epidemic has had a profound impact on the country, affecting individuals, families, and the communities. Tanzania has made remarkable progress in combating the spread of HIV through government initiatives, partnerships with international organizations, and community-based intervention.</p>
    <p>Despite these efforts, Challenges persist including limited access to healthcare in rural areas, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, and gaps in education about prevention</p>
    <p> This section provides a comprehensive look at the current state of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, highlighting the What is the HIV And AIDS, How is transmitted, Who is At Rist For HIV, Symptoms, HIV  Testing and HIV prevention.</p>

<hr>

    <h1><i>What is HIV</i></h1>
    <p>HIV(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial for fighting infection. Over time, if untreated, HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells, weakening the immune system and making the body more susceptible to infection</p>

    <h1><i>What is AIDS</i></h1>
    <p><b>AIDS (AquiredImmunodeficiency Syndrome)</b> is the advance stage of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. It occurs when the immune system become severely weakened, leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancer. AIDS is the result of untreated or poorly managed HIV over time</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> HIV is distinct from AIDS, which is the final stage of untreated HIV. With early diagnosis and treatment, most people with HIV can prevent progress to AIDS </p>

<hr>

    <h1><i>How Is HIV Transmitted?</i></h1>
      <p> The following are the ways HIV can transmit from one person to another:-</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>1. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected partner(s)</dt>
        <dd>In Tanzania, HIV is predominantly transmitted through heterosexual sex (sex between men and women). HIV is also transmitted through men having sex with men (MSM)</dd>

        <p>
          <dt>2. Contact with HIV-infected blood and blood products</dt>
          <dd>
              <li>Blood transfusion</li>
              <li>Injecting drug use (IDU) through needle-sharing</li>
              <li>Needle stick accidents, unsterilized needle</li>
          </dd> 
          </dt>
        </p>
        
        <dt>3. Mother-to-child transmission(MTCT) (during pregnancy, birth and 
        breastfeeding)</dt>
        <dd>The overall risk of MTCT is about 20% to 45% if no HIV interventions for pregnant women. MTCT accounts for over 90% of all HIV infections in children aged below 15 years. Ways for Mother-to-child transmission(MTCT) are:- </dd>
              <dd>
                  <li>Breastfeeding 5-20%</li>
                  <li>Labour and delivery 10-15%</li>
                  <li>Breastfeeding 5-20%</li>
              </dd>

      </dl>

       <p>
         <b>NOTE:</b> Risks of acquiring HIV infection differ depending on the mode of transmission. Example Needle sharing, blood transfusion and anal intercourse have the highest risk of HIV infection than other modes. Also, Blood transfusion from an HIV positive donor has the highest risk of HIV transmission. And Possible transmission of HIV through body fluids other than blood and genital secretions e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, amniotic fluids

    <h1><i>Symptoms of HIV?</i></h1>
    <p>There are several symptoms of HIV. Not everyone will have the same symptoms. It depends on the person and what stage of the disease they are in. Below are the three stages of HIV and some of the symptom people may experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Stage 1: Acute HIV infection</h3>
    <p>Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, about two-thirds of people will have a flu-like illness. This is the body’s natural response to HIV infection.</p>
    <p>Flu-like symptoms can include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Chills</li>
      <li>Rash</li>
      <li>Night sweats</li>
      <li>Sore throat</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Muscle aches</li>
      <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      <li>Mouth ulcers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. But some people do not have any symptoms at all during this early stage of HIV.</p>
    <p>Don’t assume you have HIV just because you have any of these symptoms—they can be similar to those caused by other illnesses. But if you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get an HIV test.</p>

    <h3>Stage 2: Clinical Latency</h3>
    <p>In this stage, the virus still multiplies, but at very low levels. People in this stage may not feel sick or have any symptoms. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection.</p>
    <p>Without HIV treatment, people can stay in this stage for 10 or 15 years, but some move through this stage faster.</p>
    <p>If you take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you can live and long and healthy life and will not transmit HIV to your HIV-negative partners through sex</p>
    <p>But if your viral load is detectable, you can transmit HIV during this stage, even when you have no symptoms. It’s important to see your health care provider regularly to get your viral load checked.</p>

    <h3>Stage 3: AIDS</h3>
    <p>If you have HIV and you are not on HIV treatment, eventually the virus will weaken your body’s immune system and you will progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).</p>
    <p>This is the late stage of HIV infection.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of AIDS can include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
      <li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li>
      <li>Extreme and unexplained tiredness</li>
      <li>Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck</li>
      <li>Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week</li>
      <li>Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals</li>
      <li>Pneumonia</li>
      <li>Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li>
      <li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders</li>
    </ul>
